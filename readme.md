# Introduction ![](https://github.com/xxoo/node-fswin/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

[`fswin`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fswin) is a native [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org) add-on that works on windows.
It has ported some platform specified filesystem APIs. And made them easy to use in javascript.

For details and examples please see [wiki](https://github.com/xxoo/node-fswin/wiki)

NOTE: fswin depends on n-api since v3. which requires node.js v8 or later.
